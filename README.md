# Business-Information-System-Policy-and-Strategy---Case-Studies

This repository includes my work on the case studies based on information system's strategies and policies.
I have analyzed the case studies deeply to understand it and then noted down my points.
The case studies can be found on Harvard Business website.
Prof. Ranga (UIC) is my mentor who helped me understand each and every aspect thoroughly.
